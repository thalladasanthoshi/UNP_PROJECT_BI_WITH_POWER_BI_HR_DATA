# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_HR_DATA

As part of my Business Intelligence course with United Network of Professionals (UNP), I developed an HR Analytics Dashboard to analyze and visualize key workforce metrics. The goal was to transform raw HR data into actionable insights, helping organizations make data-driven decisions on employee retention, performance, and workforce planning.

Project Workflow:

Data Collection & Understanding:

Gathered HR data and analyzed its structure to identify key variables such as employee demographics, job roles, experience, salary details, and attrition status.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Fixed missing or inconsistent values to ensure data accuracy.

Corrected and standardized data types to match the appropriate format for analysis.

Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Identified critical HR metrics such as attrition rate, average tenure, salary distribution, department-wise employee count, and performance ratings.
Creating Measures using DAX:

Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated measures for metrics like average salary, attrition percentage, and employee count trends over time.
Building Visualizations:

Designed interactive charts, graphs, and tables to represent workforce trends effectively.

Included visualizations for attrition trends, department-wise distribution, salary variations, and experience levels.

Adding Slicers & Interactivity:

Implemented slicers and filters to allow dynamic exploration of data.

Enabled users to analyze data from different perspectives, such as filtering by department, job role, or experience level.

Developing a Dynamic Dashboard:

Combined all visual elements into a user-friendly dashboard for easy navigation and analysis.

Ensured that HR professionals could quickly gain insights and make informed decisions based on real-time trends and patterns.

Outcome & Impact:

The HR Analytics Dashboard provided a comprehensive view of workforce dynamics, helping HR teams:

Identify factors contributing to employee attrition.

Analyze salary trends and department-wise workforce distribution.

Gain insights into employee performance and retention strategies.

Make strategic workforce planning decisions using data-backed insights.

This project demonstrated the power of Business Intelligence in HR analytics, showcasing how data visualization and analysis can enhance decision-making and improve organizational efficiency.
